# Lagrange-heuristic-algorithm-to-solve-p-median-model
This project presents a simple application of Lagrange heuristic algorithm on solving p-median model, a typical model in location problem. Lagrange heuristic algorithm is based on Lagrange relaxation, which is an important method on simplifing & solving (mixed) integer programming. For comparsion, the optimizer Gurobi is also used.

The data used in this project is a random sample of orders on sharing bike, provided by Mobike in a competition, around 100,000 records.
